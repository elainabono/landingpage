        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
       
        <p>Hey there! My name is Elaina Bono. I am a digital creator and visual designer with a passion for UI & UX design. I am graduating from Pennsylvania State Universtity in the Spring of 2024 as a Digital Multimedia Designer. I enjoy creating digital art by creating websites, drawing with my Apple pencil, photography, videography, animation, 3D modeling, and more. I have skills in Illustrator, After Effects, Photoshop, Premiere, InDesign, Blender, Procreate, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some other hobbies of mine include painting, shopping, pilates, yoga, reading, meditating, watching television, and snuggling up with my cat, Zara! I am finding my way in the digital design world one step at a time. Art, designing, and creating are my passions. I have a longing desire to keep expanding my knowledge and skill set. UX intersects psychology, design, research, technology, and business— making it a powerful and creative way to solve real-world problems that affect real people.
        I design for the magic of a user-first experience; combined with clean and minimalistic design.
